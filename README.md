Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Dataset
This project implements a comprehensive Sentiment Analysis pipeline on a large-scale Twitter dataset, leveraging advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and deep learning techniques to classify sentiment polarity in tweets.

Project Overview
Sentiment analysis involves identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in text to determine the writer’s attitude towards a particular topic. Here, the goal is to classify tweets into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral) by training an LSTM-based neural network on the labeled Twitter dataset.

The dataset used is a publicly available corpus containing 1.6 million processed Twitter messages with sentiment annotations.

Features
Extensive data preprocessing including text cleaning, tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming.

Handling of imbalanced data with proper train-test split ensuring model robustness.

Use of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for effective sequential data modeling of text.

Visualization tools including confusion matrix, ROC curves, and various performance metrics.

Implementation of advanced evaluation metrics such as classification reports and AUC scores.

Interactive exploratory data analysis leveraging seaborn and matplotlib libraries.

Technologies and Libraries
Python (3.7+)

Pandas, NumPy

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing

TensorFlow and Keras for LSTM modeling

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics and data splitting

MLxtend for enhanced plotting of confusion matrices

Dataset
The project utilizes the Sentiment140 dataset (training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv), which includes:

1,600,000 tweets with sentiment labels (0 = negative, 4 = positive).

Tweet metadata such as user, date, query, and tweet text.

The dataset is preprocessed by renaming columns and cleaning text for input to the model.

Setup Instructions
Clone or download the repository.

Install required Python packages:

bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn mlxtend
Download the Sentiment140 dataset (if not included) and place it in the project directory.

Run the Jupyter notebook (Sentiment_analysis.ipynb) to execute all cells step-by-step, or run script files if extracted.

Model Architecture
Embedding Layer: Converts tokens into dense vectors.

LSTM Layer: Captures long-term dependencies in sequential tweet data.

Dense Layers: Fully-connected layers for classification.

Output Layer: Softmax activation for multi-class sentiment prediction.

Optimizer: RMSprop for efficient gradient descent.

Training is monitored by accuracy and loss metrics, with validation on a hold-out test set.

Results and Evaluation
Visualization of accuracy and loss curves over epochs.

Confusion matrix showing classification performance across sentiments.

ROC Curves and AUC (Area Under Curve) scores assessing model discrimination power.

Detailed classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score.

These evaluations demonstrate the model’s ability to accurately predict sentiments of tweets from previously unseen data.

Usage
Use the trained model to classify tweet sentiment for social media monitoring or opinion mining.

Adapt the preprocessing and model parameters for different text datasets or languages.

Extend the model by integrating transformer-based architectures for potentially better performance.
